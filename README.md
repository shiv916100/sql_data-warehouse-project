# 🏗️ SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and build a **Data Warehouse** using **SQL** for analytical purposes.  
It includes the complete process from **data extraction, cleaning, transformation, loading (ETL)** to **data analysis and reporting**.

The goal is to create a centralized database that supports **business intelligence (BI)** and **data-driven decision making**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design an optimized **data warehouse schema** (Star Schema / Snowflake).
- Perform **data cleaning and transformation** using SQL.
- Implement **ETL pipeline** for structured data loading.
- Write **analytical SQL queries** for actionable insights.
- Support **Power BI** or any BI tool for reporting and visualization.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack & Tools
- **SQL Server / MySQL / PostgreSQL**
- **SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, CTEs, Window Functions)**
- **Power BI / Tableau (optional visualization)**
- **Excel / CSV data sources**

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Raw data imported from CSV/Excel sources.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling nulls, duplicates, inconsistent data.  
3. **Schema Design** – Creating dimension and fact tables.  
4. **ETL Process** – Loading cleaned data into warehouse.  
5. **Analysis** – Running queries to generate key business metrics.  
6. **Visualization** – Optional Power BI dashboard for insights.
